Title: Tic-Tac-Toe
Tech: Python
  Used a Python dictionary and print statements to make an interactive game of tic-toe-toe. I utilized a while loop to make sure that the rest of the function wouldn't run unless the player's input was a valid space. Finally, I used if statements to trigger the end of the game and declare a winner if it sensed that three "x" or "o" values were aligned.
